## Configuration

At least you should define which API calls this plugin should intercept. For example, to intercept all calls to `/api` endpoint you could use the `pathname` parameter (similar to how [cy.intercept](https://on.cypress.io/intercept) defined intercepts)

```js
// cypress.config.js

const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  env: {
    magicBackend: {
      apiCallsToIntercept: { method: '*', pathname: '/api' },
    },
  },
})
```

Sometimes the API endpoints are complicated to code using a single intercept definition. You can define an array of separate interceptors. For example, TodoMVC app might allow the following API calls only:

```js
// cypress.config.js

const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  env: {
    magicBackend: {
      // API endpoints to intercept using an array definition
      apiCallsToIntercept: [
        { method: 'GET', pathname: '/todos' },
        { method: 'POST', pathname: '/todos' },
        { method: 'DELETE', pathname: '/todos/*' },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

See [cypress-array.config.js](./cypress-array.config.js). Each intercept will show a number next to its alias, like `ü™Ñ üéûÔ∏è 1`, `ü™Ñ üéûÔ∏è 2`, etc.

## Modes

- `recording` spies on all API calls and saves a JSON file with recorded requests and responses
- `playback` stubs all API calls using the recorded JSON file. If a test does not have a recorded JSON file, the test runs normally without a magic backend
- `playback-only` stubs all API calls using the recorded JSON file. If a test does not have a recorded JSON file and the test tries to make an API call, then the test fails immediately
- `inspect` spies on all API calls in the test, comparing _types_ of the request and response objects

You can control the mode by launching the test runner with the `CYPRESS_magic_backend_mode` variable or by clicking the Magic Backend buttons in the UI.

## Using on CI

Assumption: you have probably recorded backend calls using the local `cypress open` mode. Once you are happy with the recorded JSON files, you can use them on CI during `cypress run` mode. Just set the plugin to the `playback` mode via an environment variable:

```
$ CYPRESS_magic_backend_mode=playback npx cypress run
```

Here is a GitHub Actions example

```yml
- name: Cypress against static backend
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
  with:
    start: npm run start:static
  env:
    # assume that all backend calls are pre-recorded
    # in the cypress/magic-backend folder
    # and on CI the API backend should be in playback mode
    # and completely stubbed
    CYPRESS_magic_backend_mode: playback
```

If a test does NOT have a recording, it will execute normally without any magic stubbing. If you want the test without a recording to fail on an API call attempt, use `CYPRESS_magic_backend_mode: playback-only` mode.
